<h1>hellooooooo</h1>
<h2>hellooooooo</h2>
<p>This episode was mostly catching up on where we left off in Season Five: Jaime telling Cersei that Myrcella is dead; Jon Snow is still dead; Tyrion and Varys take a stroll through Meereen; Daenerys is back with the Dothraki; Melisandre is actually old(??); Arya is blind and getting beaten up on the streets by the Waif. But the most important thing to happen is that Brienne and dear sweet Pod finally meet up with Sansa and save her from Ramsay's hounds.</p>
<p>There's some growing tension in King's Landing between the High Sparrow and Cersei, random people doing shit in the dreary Iron Islands, Bran has been sitting in a tree for two years having visions, and Tyrion is taming dragons and trying to run a whole goddamn country. But, of course, the key part of this episode is that Jon Snow is backâ€”saved by Melisandre like everyone expected.</p>
